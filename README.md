# Some building data for use in MCS 335

There are two datasets in the package that we use for a project in our [data wrangling and visualization course](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/index.html).  

```

devtools::install_github("hathawayj/buildings")

```

## Data

### climate_zone_fips

A file that has information about each county in the US and how they match to census regions and DOE climate zones.

### buildings0809

Some data I found for buildings built in Idaho during 2008 and 2009.

## Scripts and Functions

Nothing as of yet.
